## **📈 A/B Testing for Marketing Strategy Optimization – Capital Funding Products**
This project showcases how A/B testing was used to evaluate and improve marketing strategies for J. Galt's capital funding products. The test aimed to determine whether an alternative email/web variation could significantly increase user engagement, measured by click-through rates (CTR). Implemented in Python using statistical methods and visualizations.

Situation
    At J. Galt, the marketing team sought to improve engagement with their capital funding services through optimized messaging and layout. The original email campaign (Control) was seeing lower CTR than expected, and there was a need to test a new version (Variant B) to boost user interaction.

Task
    Design and execute an A/B test comparing the existing campaign (A) with a newly designed one (B). The goal was to identify whether the new strategy leads to a statistically significant uplift in click-through rate (CTR).

Action
    Implemented the entire test and analysis pipeline in Python:

    Simulated user interaction data for control (A) and variant (B) using a binomial distribution (CTR A = 10%, CTR B = 12.5%).

    Used pandas for data preparation and group-level CTR calculation.

    Applied z-test for proportions using statsmodels to determine statistical significance.

    Built visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn to compare CTRs.

    Interpreted the results and framed business recommendations accordingly.

Result
    CTR A (Control): 10.0%

    CTR B (Variant): 11.8%

    Z-Statistic: -1.2915

    P-Value: 0.1965

✅ While Variant B showed higher engagement, the uplift was not statistically significant at 95% confidence.

📢 Recommendation: Continue testing with larger sample sizes or iterate on design variations to further optimize engagement.

📊 Visual Output
    Click-Through Rate Comparison Bar Chart
    The graph shows side-by-side CTRs for Group A and B, making it easy to visualize the performance difference.

📌 Business Takeaways
    A/B testing is a powerful method to evaluate marketing performance.

    Even with a promising uplift, statistical validation is critical to making rollout decisions.

    This framework can be reused for testing new landing pages, emails, ads, or feature experiments.
